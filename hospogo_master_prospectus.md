## 1. The Problem: The $168M Logistics Void

Australia's hospitality sector employs **900,000+ workers** across **94,000 venues**. Yet **78% of neighborhood cafes, bars, and restaurants** still operate with:

- ❌ WhatsApp groups for shift scheduling
- ❌ Paper timesheets and manual payroll
- ❌ Spreadsheet compliance tracking (RSA/RCG expiry)
- ❌ No centralized talent pool

**The Logistics Void:** No integrated solution exists for suburban SMB venues that combines workforce logistics, compliance automation, and financial sync—until HospoGo.

### Market Catalyst: The Suburban Loyalty Shift

2024-2025 consumer data reveals a permanent paradigm shift:

| Segment | Foot Traffic | Staff Retention |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **CBD Venues** | -12% | 3.2% |
| **Suburban Venues** | +18% | 4.6% |

The "15-minute city" trend has redirected hospitality spend to neighborhood venues. These **72,000+ suburban operators** represent our primary TAM.

## 2. The Solution: The Trinity Architecture

**Integration is the moat.** Competitors offer point solutions. HospoGo delivers end-to-end logistics.

## 5. Competitive Landscape

### The Incumbent Gap

| Competitor | Core Weakness | HospoGo Advantage |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Deputy** | Enterprise pricing ($6+/user), no compliance vault | SMB-first ($2.50/user effective), integrated RSA/licensing |
| **Tanda** | No marketplace, manual Xero CSV export | Two-sided marketplace, real-time Xero sync |
| **Indeed Flex** | Gig-only model, no retention tools | Hybrid model with A-Team loyalty features |
| **Square Shifts** | Requires POS ecosystem lock-in | POS-agnostic, compliance-first |

### Switching Cost Moat

Once a venue activates all three Trinity engines:
1. **Vault:** Staff credentials and audit trails become embedded
2. **Marketplace:** A-Team favorites create hiring gravity
3. **Engine:** Roster templates and Xero mappings compound value

**Projected 90-day retention: 94%**
