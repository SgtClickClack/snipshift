### 2025-09-04: Multi-Role User System & Dashboard Toggle

Refactored the authentication and user model to support multiple roles per user, added UI for role switching, and updated onboarding to allow selecting multiple roles. Implemented new backend endpoints for role management.

- Backend storage and routes support multi-role
- Endpoints: `PATCH /api/users/:id/roles`, `PATCH /api/users/:id/current-role`
- Auth context updated with `setCurrentRole` and `hasRole`
- Navbar role switcher and multi-select role onboarding
- Guards and dashboards adapted to `currentRole`

### 2025-09-07: CI Playwright Port Conflict Fix and Smoke Test

Resolved Playwright CI failure caused by port 5000 already in use by ensuring CI does not start an additional server and that diagnostics are captured.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- Updated workflow to free port 5000, start prod server, wait-on health, and emit diagnostics (netstat, curl)
- Forced Playwright CI to not start webServer by using CI config and `PW_NO_SERVER=1`
- Limited CI Playwright to Chromium for stability; baseURL set to `http://localhost:5000`
- Added `tests/smoke.spec.ts` to verify server responds at root

**File Paths:**
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- `playwright.ci.config.ts`
- `tests/smoke.spec.ts`

**Next Priority Task:**
- Re-run CI; if Playwright still tries to start a server, capture last 100 lines and refine config/env.
