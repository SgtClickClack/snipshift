### 2025-11-25: UI Polish: Contrast & Card Hierarchy

Polished the UI contrast and card hierarchy to enforce a "Chrome Background" vs "White Card" design pattern. This ensures content pops against the background and avoids a flat look.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- Professional Dashboard: Updated background and card styles.
- Job Feed: Wrapped main content in white card containers.
- Applications Page: Improved list container contrast.
- Quick Actions: Standardized card styling.

**File Paths:**
- `src/pages/professional-dashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/quick-actions.tsx`
- `src/pages/job-feed.tsx`
- `src/pages/my-applications.tsx`

**Next Priority Task:**
- Final QA and Deployment.
