## CEO Admin Access Audit & Secret Door Installation

### Completed Tasks

1. **FIX_REDIRECT_LOOP** - Fixed redirect loop preventing CEO from accessing admin routes
   - **Issue**: `AuthContext.tsx` was redirecting all business users to `/venue/dashboard` before `ProtectedRoute` could apply founder bypass
   - **Fix**: Added import for `isFounderEmail` from `@/lib/roles` and early return check in `hydrateFromFirebaseUser` that bypasses dashboard redirect when:
     - `currentPath.startsWith('/admin')` AND
     - `isFounderEmail(apiUser.email)` returns true
   - **Files Modified**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

2. **INSTALL_SECRET_DOOR_BUTTON** - Added ARCHITECT PORTAL floating button
   - **Location**: Bottom-right corner of Logistics Engine (`/venue/dashboard`)
   - **Visibility**: Only `julian.g.roberts@gmail.com`
   - **Style**: Electric Lime glow (#CCFF00), Urbanist 900 font, Brain icon
   - **Action**: Navigates to `/admin/cto-dashboard`
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/venue-dashboard.tsx`
     - Added `Brain` to lucide-react imports
     - Added floating button component before closing `</div>`

3. **ROLE_CLAIM_VERIFICATION** - Verified requireAdmin middleware configuration
   - **Status**: Already correctly configured
   - **Backend** (`api/_src/middleware/auth.ts`): 
     - `FOUNDER_EMAILS` array includes `julian.g.roberts@gmail.com`
     - `requireAdmin` checks `isFounder` and allows access regardless of role claim
     - All email comparisons are case-insensitive

### Technical Notes

- Frontend `isFounderEmail` in `src/lib/roles.ts` mirrors backend `FOUNDER_EMAILS`
- `ProtectedRoute` already had founder bypass implemented, but `AuthContext` redirect was preempting it
- The fix ensures the auth hydration logic respects admin routes for founders before triggering automatic dashboard redirects

### Files Changed Summary
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added founder email import and admin route bypass
- `src/pages/venue-dashboard.tsx` - Added ARCHITECT PORTAL floating button

## Build Fix - Duplicate Variable Declaration

### Issue
Vercel build failed with error: `The symbol "url" has already been declared` at `src/lib/queryClient.ts:373`

### Root Cause
Commit `c0143e0` (auth handshake stall pattern) added `const url = queryKey.join("/")` at line 335 but didn't remove the existing declaration at line 373, creating a duplicate variable in the same scope.

### Fix
Removed the duplicate declaration at line 373, keeping only the one at line 335.

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Removed duplicate `url` variable declaration

### Commit
`57321d6` - fix(build): remove duplicate url variable declaration in queryClient

## UI & Auth Stabilization - STABILIZE_HOSPOGO_UI_AND_AUTH

### Completed Tasks

1. **STRICT_HYDRATION_GATE** - Eliminated auth rehydration storm
   - **Issue**: API calls were firing before Firebase handshake completed, causing 401 storm
   - **Fix**: Strengthened the `isSystemReady` gate in `src/App.tsx` to block ALL page content until auth is ready
   - **Changes**:
     - Added `isPublicRoute` check for landing/status/waitlist/investor routes that never need auth
     - If `!isSystemReady` and not a public/bridge/signup route, show `<LoadingScreen />` instead of rendering content
     - This ensures no authenticated API calls fire before Firebase token is available
   - **Files Modified**: `src/App.tsx`

2. **REPOSITION_ARCHITECT_BUTTON** - Fixed z-fighting with chatbot icon
   - **Issue**: ARCHITECT PORTAL button at `bottom-6 right-6` was overlapping with Support Chat widget
   - **Fix**: Moved button to bottom-left (`left-6`) adjacent to ENGINE STATUS ticker
   - **Changes**:
     - Changed from `right-6` to `left-6`
     - Changed z-index from `z-40` to `z-50` (above footer, below chat modal)
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/venue-dashboard.tsx`

3. **FIX_REDIRECT_LOGIC** - Prevented founder redirect to /venue/dashboard
   - **Issue**: AuthContext was inconsistently using `location.pathname` vs `window.location.pathname`, causing race conditions
   - **Root Cause**: Founders with `business` role were sometimes getting redirected to `/venue/dashboard` instead of staying on `/admin/cto-dashboard`
   - **Fix**:
     - Made path checking consistent by using `currentPath` throughout
     - Added `isFounder` check to targetPath calculation - founders target `/admin/cto-dashboard`
     - Added extra guard so founders on any `/admin/*` route never get redirected
   - **Files Modified**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### Technical Notes

- The `isSystemReady` flag in AuthContext gates all API calls via the `startAuthHandshake`/`completeAuthHandshake` mechanism
- Founders identified via `isFounderEmail()` from `src/lib/roles.ts`
- The ARCHITECT PORTAL button is now positioned at bottom-left, well clear of the Support Chat (bottom-right)
