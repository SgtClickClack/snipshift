# 2026-02-05 - Final Verification and Diagnostic Sweep

## Context: Investor Briefing Final Stabilization

### Task 1: Strategic Unskip Critical Paths ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `tests/e2e/calendar-comprehensive.spec.ts`
  - Unskipped `Business Owner: Capacity & Automation Workflow` describe block
  - Unskipped `Professional: Staff Invitation & Acceptance` describe block
  - Left `Dual-Context: Full Roster Lifecycle` skipped (complex DB state required)

### Task 2: Execute Full Diagnostic Run ✅
**Command:** `npx playwright test --project=business-e2e --project=staff-e2e`

**Results:**
- **29 passed**
- **28 skipped** (visual regressions, complex journeys)
- **0 failed**
- **Exit code: 0**

**Console Error Manifest Results:**
- ✅ No React #310 errors detected
- ✅ No React #31 errors detected
- ✅ No Minified React errors detected
- ✅ All manifests show "No console errors detected"

### Task 3: AI Liaison Final Grounding ✅
**File Verified:** `api/_src/services/ai-investor.service.ts`

```typescript
export const INVESTOR_INITIAL_MESSAGE = `Welcome to the HospoGo Data Room. I am the Foundry Executive Agent, grounded in our strategic prospectus and audited R&D. How can I assist your due diligence today?`;
```
✅ Confirmed - starts with correct greeting

**Terminology Enforcement (Lines 210-219):**
- "Logistics Platform Fee" strictly enforced for pricing queries
- "$149/month Logistics Platform Fee" is the ONLY acceptable way to describe pricing
- CRITICAL comment enforces this rule

### Task 6: Bot Isolation - Strict Investor/Support Separation ✅

**Context:** Investor Briefing Final Polish - Enforcing Bot Context Boundaries

**Changes Made:**

**1. SupportChatWidget (`src/components/support/SupportChatWidget.tsx`)**
- ✅ Added: `useLocation` hook import from react-router-dom
- ✅ Added: Route-based isolation check `location.pathname.startsWith('/investorportal')`
- ✅ Updated: `shouldRender` logic now includes `&& !isInvestorPortal`
- ✅ Behavior: Support bot NEVER renders on `/investorportal` route

**2. InvestorChatWidget (`src/components/investor/InvestorChatWidget.tsx`)**
- ✅ Added: `useLocation` hook import from react-router-dom
- ✅ Added: Safety check `if (!location.pathname.startsWith('/investorportal')) return null;`
- ✅ Behavior: Investor bot ONLY renders on `/investorportal` route
- ✅ Note: This is a secondary safety net (widget is already only rendered in InvestorPortal.tsx)

**Bot Isolation Rules:**
| Route | Support Bot | Investor Bot |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `/investorportal` | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Visible |
| `/venue/dashboard` | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| `/professional-dashboard` | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| Any other route | ✅ Visible (if onboarded) | ❌ Hidden |

**Why This Matters:**
- Investors only see the Foundry Executive Agent (capital-raising context)
- Venue owners only see the Support Specialist (logistics context)
- No context confusion or mixed messaging between audiences

---

### Task 7: Final Documentation Signoff ✅
**File Updated:** `FINAL_READINESS_CERTIFICATE.md`

**Changes:**
- Version: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
- Date: 2026-02-04 → 2026-02-05

- Added test results summary (29 passed, 28 skipped, 0 failed)
- Added certification: "Error #310 Hook Integrity Verified"

---

## Files Modified

---

## Task 6: Emergency Onboarding Restoration ✅

**Context:** Investor Briefing - Modern Onboarding Identity Restoration

### Changes Made:

**1. Role Selection Page (`src/pages/role-selection.tsx`) - COMPLETE REWRITE**
- ❌ Removed: Brand and Trainer role cards
- ✅ New: 2-card layout only (Venue Owner vs Professional)
- ✅ Glassmorphism styling with `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md`
- ✅ Electric Lime (`#BAFF39`) borders and accents
- ✅ Typography: `font-black tracking-tighter` applied to heading
- ✅ Hook integrity: All hooks hoisted to top, no early returns before hooks
- ✅ No API calls on this page - just navigates to appropriate onboarding flow

**2. Fixed API Endpoint Mismatches (404 Resolution)**
- `src/pages/onboarding/professional.tsx`: Changed `/api/users/onboarding/complete` → `/api/onboarding/complete`
- `src/pages/Onboarding.tsx`: Changed `/api/users/onboarding/complete` → `/api/onboarding/complete`
- `src/pages/home.tsx`: Changed `/api/users/onboarding/complete` → `/api/onboarding/complete`

**3. Route Verification**
- ✅ App.tsx routes `/role-selection` and `/onboarding/role-selection` to `RoleSelectionPage`
- ✅ App.tsx routes `/onboarding/professional` to `ProfessionalOnboardingPage`
- ✅ App.tsx routes `/onboarding/hub` to `HubOnboardingPage`
- ✅ AuthContext redirects `needsOnboarding` users to `/role-selection`

### Onboarding Flow Now:
1. New user signs up → Firebase auth
2. `/api/me` returns `needsOnboarding: true`
3. AuthContext redirects to `/role-selection`
4. User picks role → Navigates to `/onboarding/professional` or `/onboarding/hub`
5. Onboarding form submits to `/api/onboarding/complete`
6. API sets `isOnboarded: true` → User redirects to dashboard

### Error #310 Prevention:
- All hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`) are at the top of component
- Early returns (loading states) come AFTER all hooks are registered
- No conditional hook calls

---

## Mission Status: **READY**

All critical verification tasks completed:
- ✅ Strategic unskips applied
- ✅ Diagnostic run clean (0 errors)
- ✅ AI Liaison grounded correctly
- ✅ Xero empty state polished
- ✅ Final certification updated
- ✅ **Onboarding Identity Restored** (2-card, Electric Lime, Hook-safe)

All 5 legacy FAQ entries replaced with "Foundry" investor-grade entries:
- Q1: "What is the HospoGo Trinity?" — The Vault, The Market, The Engine
- Q2: "How are staff verified?" — DVS API handshakes, automated compliance gating
- Q3: "What is the Logistics Platform Fee?" — Flat $149/month, no "Success Taxes"
- Q4: "Does this replace my current payroll software?" — Mutex-locked Xero handshake
- Q5: "What is Suburban Loyalty?" — 4.6% higher retention for Neighborhood Locals

**2. Branding & Typography Sync**

- Active/expanded state: Electric Lime (`#BAFF39`) applied to:
  - Question text when expanded
  - Bottom border when expanded
  - Chevron icon when expanded

**3. Mobile UX Enhancements**
- Added `px-4 sm:px-6` responsive padding for mobile tappability
- ShieldCheck icon (Lucide) added to "How are staff verified?" question

**4. Markdown Bold Rendering**
- `renderAnswer()` helper function parses `**text**` syntax
- Renders as `<strong className="text-white font-semibold">` elements

**5. ARIA Fix**
- Fixed `aria-expanded` lint error (changed from string to boolean)

---

## Task 8: Investor Briefing Final Polish - Session 2 ✅

**Context:** Final onboarding bypass fix and knowledge base expansion

### Changes Made:

**1. Killed Failsafe Dashboard Redirect (`src/components/auth/google-auth-button.tsx`)**
- **Issue:** Google auth was navigating directly to `/dashboard`, bypassing onboarding for new users
- **Fix:** Changed `navigate('/dashboard')` → `navigate('/onboarding')`
