# OAuth Debug - Still Getting Error 401

## Current Issue
Still getting "Error 401: invalid_client" which means Google can't find a valid OAuth client.

## Verified Configuration
- Client ID: 399353553154-211k03t5hm4vnrvrgrsnqqna6q90o0nb.apps.googleusercontent.com
- Domain: https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Propagation Delay (Most Common)
Google OAuth changes take 5-15 minutes to propagate globally. If you just saved the changes, wait longer.

### 2. Exact Domain Match Required
Even a tiny difference will cause this error. The domain in Google Cloud Console must be EXACTLY:
https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev

### 3. Client ID Mismatch
The Client ID might have been copied incorrectly.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Wait 15 minutes** from your last Google Cloud Console save
2. **Use incognito mode** to test (clears all cache)
3. **Verify Client ID** - copy it again from Google Cloud Console
4. **Double-check domain** - make sure no typos in Google Cloud Console

## If Still Not Working
Create a completely new OAuth client in Google Cloud Console and use that Client ID instead.
