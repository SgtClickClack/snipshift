Snipshift: Final MVP Feature & Compliance Rollout ðŸš€
Objective:
Complete the final features and compliance requirements to make the MVP fully production-ready and to make your business partner happy for the first run.

1. Project Context & Vision
App Name: Snipshift

Current State: All core features (dashboards, shifts, social feed, multi-role auth) are functional. The focus is now on implementing the remaining features from the business plan to deliver a complete MVP for the Barber Expo.

Goal: Finalize the platform's functionality and compliance, including payment systems, legal documentation, and final user role-specific features.

2. Final Rollout Checklist
Implement the following features to complete the MVP:

Geolocation Map & Interstate Toggle:

Implement a geolocation map on the shift feed that shows shifts within a specific radius.

Add an "Interstate toggle" filter that allows barbers to browse shifts in other states. 


User Role Enhancements:


Barbers: Implement the Payments and Insurance Support features, including the Get Insured button that links to a partner quote form. 


Brands/Trainers: Implement the Payments feature, including the Stripe Connect onboarding for trainers to sell content and a tracking system for off-platform payments. 

Basic Stripe Escrow System:

Implement a basic escrow system where shops pay via the Stripe Payment Element.

The funds should be held in the platform's account for manual payouts to barbers post-shift. 

Legal & Compliance:

Create a draft for the Terms of service and Privacy policy documents.

Implement a non-spam policy for the social feed and ensure compliance with Australian contractor regulations. 

Beta & Expo Plan:

Set up the demo mode for the Barber Expo. This will allow a barber to pick up an interstate shift, and the Stripe escrow flow will be simulated. 

3. Technical & Architectural Instructions
API Integrations: Integrate with the Stripe API for escrow and payments. This should be a mock implementation for now, but the framework should be in place. 

Legal: Create placeholder pages for the Terms of service and Privacy policy.


Testing: Ensure all the new features are covered by your existing E2E testing framework. 

Final Instruction:

Implement the final features and compliance requirements to complete the MVP. Your final deliverable is a fully functional, production-ready application that delivers on the promises made to your business partner.
