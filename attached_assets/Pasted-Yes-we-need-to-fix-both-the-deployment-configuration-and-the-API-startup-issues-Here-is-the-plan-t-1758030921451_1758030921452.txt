Yes, we need to fix both the deployment configuration and the API startup issues. Here is the plan to resolve everything in parallel.

-----

### Part 1: Your Action â€” Correcting the `.replit` File

The current `.replit` file is mixing local development commands (`docker-compose`) with an outdated deployment format that won't work on Cloud Run.

Please **replace the entire content** of your `.replit` file with the following corrected and simplified configuration. This is the definitive version for both local development and deployment.

```toml
# This is the corrected configuration for both local development and deployment.

# This command is executed by the main "Run" button for local development.
run = "npm --prefix snipshift-next/api run dev"

# This section defines the commands for production deployment on Replit Autoscale.
[deployment]
build = "npm --prefix snipshift-next/api install && npm --prefix snipshift-next/api run build"
run = "npm --prefix snipshift-next/api run start"

# This tells Replit which port to expose for the web preview.
[[ports]]
localPort = 4000
externalPort = 80
```

### Part 2: My Action â€” Fixing the API Startup Issues

While you are updating the `.replit` file, I will provide the prompt for the agent to troubleshoot and fix the underlying server startup problems. This way, we can solve both issues at the same time.

```yaml
role: |
  You are a senior backend developer specializing in Node.js, GraphQL, and debugging complex server startup failures.

request: |
  The deployment configuration is being fixed separately. Your sole focus is to resolve the remaining code-level issues that are preventing the API server from starting successfully.

  Your task is to troubleshoot the API service, identify the root cause of the startup failure, and apply the necessary fixes to make the server operational.

  1.  **Start the Server:** From the `snipshift-next/api` directory, attempt to start the server in development mode using the `npm run dev` command.

  2.  **Analyze the Error:** Carefully examine the error messages and stack traces that appear in the console. Do not focus on deployment; focus only on why the Node.js process itself is failing.

  3.  **Investigate and Fix:** Common issues to investigate include:
      -   Database connection timeouts or credential errors.
      -   Missing or incorrect environment variables in the Replit "Secrets" tab.
      -   Circular dependencies or breaking changes in a recently updated package.
      -   Type errors or syntax issues in the main `src/index.ts` or server setup files.

  4.  **Confirm the Fix:** Apply the necessary code changes to resolve the issue. The task is complete when you can successfully start the server and it remains running without crashing.
```

By tackling both the configuration and the code in parallel, we can resolve all blocking issues efficiently. ðŸ”§
