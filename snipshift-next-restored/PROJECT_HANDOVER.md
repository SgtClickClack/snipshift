- **Native Mobile App**: A React Native application with Expo for iOS and Android, featuring offline capabilities and native performance
- **Modern Web App**: A Next.js application with server-side rendering and progressive web app features
- **Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment workflows using GitHub Actions with comprehensive testing and security scanning
- **Unified Architecture**: Consistent codebase structure across all platforms with shared types and utilities
- **Database Modernization**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Real-time Features**: Redis-backed real-time messaging and notifications system
- **Containerized Infrastructure**: Docker-based development and deployment environment

## Section 2: Final Architecture Overview

### Backend (`api/`)

- **Testing**: Jest with integration tests and test utilities
- **Container**: Docker with multi-stage builds for optimized production images

### Mobile App (`mobile/`)
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for native navigation patterns
- **State Management**: Apollo Client for GraphQL data with React Query for local state
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with consistent design system
- **Offline Support**: Apollo Client cache with offline mutation queuing
- **Platform Features**: Native camera, location services, push notifications
- **Build Tools**: Expo Application Services (EAS) for builds and deployments

### Web App (`web/`)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Data Fetching**: Apollo Client for GraphQL with server-side rendering support
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js integration with OAuth providers
- **Performance**: Optimized with Next.js features including ISR and middleware
- **Progressive Web App**: Service worker, offline capabilities, and installable
- **Build Tools**: Next.js optimized build system with TypeScript compilation

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment environments
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development with all services
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for primary data storage with Redis for caching
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging infrastructure
- **Security**: Environment-based configuration with secure secret management

## Section 3: Getting Started for New Developers

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- (Optional) Expo CLI for mobile development

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone and Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snipshift-next
   make setup
   ```
   This command will:
   - Copy the environment template to `.env`
   - Start all Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Install dependencies for all services

2. **Configure Environment**
   Edit the `.env` file with your actual configuration values for:
   - Database connection strings
   - JWT secrets
   - OAuth provider credentials
   - API keys for external services

3. **Start Development Environment**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   This starts all services:
   - API: http://localhost:4000/graphql
   - Web: http://localhost:3000
   - Database: localhost:5432
   - Redis: localhost:6379
   - pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
   This runs the complete test suite across all services.

### Development Workflow
- Use `make help` to see all available commands
- Individual services can be started with `make api-dev`, `make web-dev`
- Database operations: `make db-migrate`, `make db-studio`
- Docker management: `make docker-up`, `make docker-down`

## Section 4: Key Documentation Links

### Primary Documentation
- **[API Documentation](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md)**: Complete GraphQL schema documentation, resolver details, and API usage examples
- **[Launch & Operations Handbook](docs/LAUNCH_PLAN.md)**: Deployment procedures, monitoring setup, and operational runbooks
- **[Repository README](../README.md)**: Project overview, architecture details, and contribution guidelines

### Additional Resources
- **Makefile**: Comprehensive list of development commands (`make help`)
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- **Database Schema**: `api/src/database/schema.ts` for data model definitions
- **GraphQL Schema**: `api/src/graphql/schema.ts` for API type definitions
