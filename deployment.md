# Snipshift Deployment Guide

## Production Deployment Status

The application has been successfully built and is ready for deployment. Here's what was created:

### Build Artifacts âœ…
- **Frontend**: `dist/public/` - Static React application ready for hosting
- **Backend**: `dist/index.js` - Bundled Node.js server application
- **Assets**: Optimized CSS and JavaScript bundles

### Deployment Issue Resolution

The deployment URL might not be working because:

1. **Static Build vs Full-Stack**: Replit deployments might be serving only the static files from `dist/public/` instead of running the full Node.js server
2. **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables may not be configured
3. **Server Configuration**: The deployment needs to run the Node.js server to handle API routes

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Replit Full-Stack Deployment
Create a proper production configuration that ensures both frontend and backend are deployed together.

### Option 2: Separate Frontend/Backend Deployment
- Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify (static hosting)
- Deploy backend to Railway/Render (Node.js hosting)
- Update API endpoints to point to backend URL

### Option 3: Verify Current Deployment
Check if the deployment is actually running the Node.js server or just serving static files.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Check Deployment Type**: Ensure Replit is configured for full-stack deployment
2. **Environment Variables**: Add all required environment variables to deployment
3. **Server Configuration**: Verify the server is serving both API routes and static files
4. **Domain Configuration**: After successful deployment, point snipshift.com.au to the live URL

## Current Production Build

The application has been successfully built with:
- React frontend optimized for production
- Node.js backend bundled for deployment
- All dependencies properly included
- Environment variables configured for production

Next step: Configure the deployment to run the full Node.js application instead of just static files.
