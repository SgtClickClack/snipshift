# üîí Snipshift SSL Certificate - SOLUTION FOUND

## Issue Resolution Summary
‚úÖ **DNS**: Fully propagated - both domains point to Replit  
‚úÖ **Project**: Correctly configured for autoscale deployment  
‚ùå **SSL**: Certificate not issued because domain needs configuration in Deployment Settings

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Access Deployment Settings
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click **"Deploy"** button (or go to deployment dashboard)
3. Navigate to **"Settings"** tab in deployment view
4. Find **"Custom Domains"** section

### Step 2: Configure Custom Domain  
1. In Custom Domains section, click **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter: `www.snipshift.com.au`
3. Replit will verify DNS and auto-issue SSL certificate
4. Wait 2-10 minutes for certificate provisioning

### Step 3: Verification
Test HTTPS once configured:
```bash
curl -I https://www.snipshift.com.au
```

## Why This Works
- Replit automatically provides TLS/SSL certificates for custom domains
- Configuration must be done in **Deployment Settings** (not project settings)
- DNS is already correctly pointing to Replit infrastructure
- Certificate issuance is automatic once domain is properly added

## Expected Timeline
- Domain verification: Instant (DNS already correct)
- SSL certificate issuance: 2-10 minutes
- Full HTTPS functionality: Complete

**Result**: `https://www.snipshift.com.au` will be fully secured and ready for production launch.
