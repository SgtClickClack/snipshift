# Google OAuth Callback Fix

## Issue Analysis
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth authorization working
- ‚ùå White screen after successful authentication
- üéØ Root cause: Content Security Policy blocking Google OAuth scripts/styles

## Root Cause Identified: CSP Violations
Console errors showed CSP blocking:
- `https://accounts.google.com/gsi/style` (stylesheet)
- `https://accounts.google.com/` (frame source)
- `https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js` (script)

## Changes Made
1. **CSP Fix**: Updated Content Security Policy to allow Google OAuth
   - Added `https://accounts.google.com` to style-src
   - Added `https://replit.com` to script-src
   - Added `frame-src` directive for Google OAuth iframes
   - Changed X-Frame-Options from DENY to SAMEORIGIN
2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track OAuth flow
3. **Role Detection**: Extract role from URL query parameters (?role=professional)
4. **Smart Navigation**: Navigate to appropriate dashboard based on user role

## Debug Console Output Expected
When testing Google OAuth, you should see:
- üöÄ Google OAuth callback received
- ‚úÖ JWT decoded successfully
- üë§ Created user object with role: [role]
- üéØ Navigating to: [dashboard-path]

1. Click Professional button (goes to /signup?role=professional)
