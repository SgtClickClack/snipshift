# Google OAuth Configuration Fix

## Current Issue
Google authentication is failing due to domain authorization problems. The app is trying to use Google OAuth but the current Replit domain is not authorized in the Google Cloud Console.

## Current Domain
Your Replit app is running on:
```
https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-workspace.juliangroberts.repl.co
```

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add the current domain to "Authorized JavaScript origins":
   ```
   https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-workspace.juliangroberts.repl.co
   ```

### 2. For Production Deployment
When you deploy to `snipshift.com.au`, add:
```
https://snipshift.com.au
```

### 3. Alternative: Use Demo Mode
The app now includes a unified Google auth component that works in demo mode when OAuth is not properly configured. This allows testing the complete flow without requiring Google OAuth setup.

## What I Fixed
1. Created a unified Google authentication component (`GoogleAuthUnified`) that:
   - Handles both sign-in and sign-up flows
   - Works in demo mode when Google OAuth is not configured
   - Provides proper error handling and user feedback
   - Maintains the same user experience

2. Updated both login and signup pages to use the new unified component
3. Simplified the authentication flow to avoid conflicts between Firebase and @react-oauth/google

## Testing
- The Google sign-in buttons now work in demo mode
- Users can test the complete authentication flow
- All role-based navigation works correctly
- No more authentication conflicts

## Next Steps
1. Configure the proper domain in Google Cloud Console for production use
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Deploy to production domain and update OAuth settings accordingly
