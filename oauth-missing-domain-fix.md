# Google OAuth Missing Domain - Action Required

## ✅ Problem Identified!

From your Google Cloud Console screenshot, I can see the **development domain is missing** from the authorized origins.

## Current Authorized Domains (from screenshot):
- `https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev` ❌ **MISSING**
- `https://www.snipshift.com.au` ✅ Present
- `https://snipshift.com.au` ✅ Present

## Immediate Action Required

You need to **ADD** the missing development domain:

### Step 1: Add to Authorized JavaScript Origins
Click "+ ADD URI" and add:
```
https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev
```

### Step 2: Add to Authorized Redirect URIs (scroll down)
Click "+ ADD URI" and add:
```
https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev
```

### Step 3: Save
Click "SAVE" at the bottom

### Step 4: Test (wait 2-5 minutes)
- Google authentication should work immediately after saving
- Try in incognito mode to avoid cache issues

## Expected Result
✅ Google OAuth will work on the development domain
✅ Keep production domains for when you deploy to www.snipshift.com.au

This is exactly why it's been blocked - the domain wasn't actually added to the authorized list!
