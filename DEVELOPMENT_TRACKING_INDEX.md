# Development Tracking Index

This index tracks all development tracking files used to document progress on the HospoGo project.

## Tracking Files

- [DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_PART_01.md](./DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_PART_01.md) - Core development log (2025-11-17 onwards)
- [DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_PART_02.md](./DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_PART_02.md) - Core development log (2025-12-14 onwards)

## Format

Each tracking entry follows this structure:

- **Date header**: `#### YYYY-MM-DD: [Title]`
- **Core Components**: List of file paths/components affected
- **Key Features**: Bullet list of what was implemented/changed
- **Integration Points**: npm scripts, API endpoints, or integration touchpoints
- **File Paths**: List of modified/created files
- **Next Priority Task**: What to work on next
- **Code Organization & Quality** (optional): Notes about code quality improvements

## Usage

When completing a task, add a new entry to the most recent tracking part file. If a part file exceeds ~500 lines, create a new part file and update this index.
