# Google OAuth PostMessage Error Fix

## Issue Identified
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'postMessage')
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in Google's Transform Layer Library when the OAuth popup/iframe tries to communicate back to the parent window but the reference is null.

## Fixes Applied
1. **Enhanced CSP**: Added `unsafe-eval` and `child-src` directives
2. **OAuth Configuration**: Disabled OneTap and FedCM features that may conflict
3. **Error Handling**: Added script load success/error callbacks
4. **X-Frame-Options**: Changed from DENY to SAMEORIGIN to allow iframe communication

## Changes Made
- CSP: Added `unsafe-eval` to script-src (required for Google OAuth)
- CSP: Added `child-src` directive for iframe communication
- GoogleLogin: Disabled `useOneTap` and `use_fedcm_for_prompt`
- Provider: Added script load callbacks for better debugging

## Testing
After these changes, Google OAuth should work without postMessage errors.
The authentication flow should complete successfully and navigate to the dashboard.
