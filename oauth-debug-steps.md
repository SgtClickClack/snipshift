# Google OAuth Still Blocked - Debug Steps

## Current Status
- ✅ Client ID: `399353553154-63hnrqcqpf5m2mqzdu6oq28glhz7.apps.googleusercontent.com` (Correct)
- ❌ Domain Authorization: Still showing "invalid_client"

## Possible Issues

### 1. Domain Not Added Correctly
**Check in Google Cloud Console**:
- Ensure EXACT domain is added: `https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev`
- Check both "Authorized JavaScript origins" AND "Authorized redirect URIs"
- Make sure you clicked "SAVE" after adding

### 2. Propagation Time
- Google changes can take 2-15 minutes
- If just added, wait a bit longer

### 3. Browser Cache
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser cache completely

### 4. Verify Domain Match
Double-check the domain in Google Console matches EXACTLY:
```
https://b9c30b6a-0bb9-491f-8312-4ea2996a1e40-00-1z5x1ywkgc76h.picard.replit.dev
```

## Alternative Test: Add localhost
For immediate testing, temporarily add to Google Cloud Console:
- `http://localhost:5000` (for local testing)
- Remove it later for security

## Verification Steps
1. **Check Google Cloud Console**: Domain added and saved?
2. **Wait Time**: Has it been 5+ minutes since saving?  
3. **Clear Cache**: Tried incognito mode?
4. **Exact Match**: Domain matches character-for-character?

If all above are correct and it's still blocked, there may be an issue with the OAuth client configuration that requires recreating it.
