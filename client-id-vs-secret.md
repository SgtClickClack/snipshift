# Client ID vs Client Secret - FOUND THE ISSUE!

## The Problem
You provided the **Client Secret** instead of the **Client ID**.

## Current (WRONG):
- **What's in Replit**: `GOCSPX-bQxmYHObiLfSjfPZaYXZ9O2...` (This is the CLIENT SECRET)
- **Format**: Starts with `GOCSPX-`

## What We Need (CORRECT):
- **Client ID**: Should look like `399353553154-63hnrqcqpf5m2mqzdu6oq28glhz7.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Format**: Ends with `.apps.googleusercontent.com`

## Where to Find the Client ID
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the list
3. The **Client ID** is in the left column (longer string ending with .apps.googleusercontent.com)
4. The **Client secret** is in the right column (shorter string starting with GOCSPX-)

## Why This Matters
- **Client ID**: Used for frontend authentication (what we need)
- **Client Secret**: Used for backend server-to-server authentication (not needed for our setup)

## Next Step
Copy the correct **Client ID** from Google Cloud Console and update Replit with it.
