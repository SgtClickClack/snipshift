# Snipshift SSL Certificate Audit Report

**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Domain:** www.snipshift.com.au  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è SSL Certificate Issue Identified

---

## Executive Summary

The SSL certificate audit has revealed that while DNS propagation is complete and the domain is properly pointing to Replit's infrastructure, there is an SSL certificate mismatch causing HTTPS connection failures.

---

## DNS Configuration Status ‚úÖ

### 1. DNS Propagation - COMPLETE
- **Root Domain (snipshift.com.au):** ‚úÖ Resolving to 34.111.179.208
- **WWW Subdomain (www.snipshift.com.au):** ‚úÖ Resolving to 34.111.179.208  
- **TXT Verification Record:** ‚úÖ Present and correct
  ```
  "replit-verify=0859465e-9cd4-4470-825e-3707539239f1"
  ```

### 2. Project Configuration - VERIFIED
- **.replit file:** ‚úÖ Properly configured for deployment
- **Port Configuration:** ‚úÖ Port 5000 mapped to external port 80
- **Deployment Target:** ‚úÖ Set to "autoscale"

## SSL Certificate Issue üö®

### Root Cause Analysis
The HTTPS connection is failing with the error:
```
SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target hostname 'www.snipshift.com.au'
```

This indicates that:
1. An SSL certificate IS present on the server
2. The certificate does NOT include "www.snipshift.com.au" in its Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list
3. The certificate is likely for a different domain or the generic Replit domain

### Current State
- **HTTP (Port 80):** ‚úÖ Working - Returns 301 redirect to HTTPS
- **HTTPS (Port 443):** ‚ùå Failing - SSL certificate mismatch
- **Domain Verification:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Resolution Strategy

### Immediate Action Required
The "Enable SSL" button is likely not appearing because Replit's system detects the domain is already configured but the SSL certificate needs to be regenerated or updated to include the correct domain.

### Recommended Solution
1. **Contact Replit Support** - This appears to be a certificate provisioning issue that requires backend intervention
2. **Alternative: Remove and Re-add Domain** - Sometimes re-adding the domain triggers proper certificate generation
3. **Verify Project Deployment Status** - Ensure the project is fully deployed (not just running in development)

### Technical Details for Support
- Domain: www.snipshift.com.au
- IP Address: 34.111.179.208

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Check if project is in "Production" deployment mode
2. **If Issue Persists:** Contact Replit Support with this audit report
3. **Timeline:** SSL certificate issues typically resolve within 24-48 hours once properly triggered
